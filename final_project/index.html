          <h2>Hi there!</h2>
          <p>I am a graphic designer, illustrator, and animator based in NYC with 4+ years of experience (both in-studio and in-house). While I’m self-motivated, I thrive in a group environment where conversation and collaboration are encouraged. As designers, we have myriad tools at our disposal, and I’m interested in using what’s needed to create innovative and beautiful design.</p>

          <h2>I like:</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Film Photography</li>
            <li>Yoga</li>
            <li>Boxing</li>
            <li>My Dog</li>
          </ul>

          <p>On weekends, I’m usually hanging out with Nora and my husband in Brooklyn, in search of the next great craft beer.</p>
